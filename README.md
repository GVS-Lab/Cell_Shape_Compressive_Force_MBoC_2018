# Cell Shape modulates transcriptional response to Compressive Force
Analysis used in Damodaran et.al, Molecular Biology of the Cell , 2018 

In the paper, we study the cellular response of cells of two different shapes (rectangle and circle) to the compressive force. 

In this repository, we share the scripts used to analyse the transciption profile of rectangular and circular cells with and without compressive force. Our transcirptional analyis proved that there are cell shape dependent gene expression changes to compressive force.

We also present scripts used for specific image processing tasks. 
1. *hcecratio.ijm* was used to obtain the Heterochromatin to Euchromatin Ratio

2. *actinvsheight.ijm* was used to calculate changes in actin intenisty along the height of the cell.
